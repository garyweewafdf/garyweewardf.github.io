                <h2> Cafe For Heroes </h2> <br>
                <p> <b> Founded in 2007 </b>, Cafe for Heroes is a Coffee shop with the aim to not only make good coffee but to help the people 
                    who put their lives on the line for our safety. </p> <br>
                <p> Currently we have over 50 stores located all over the United Kingdom, we provide a varied range of coffees accompanied with 
                    delicious cakes baked fresh in our bakeries and food for our customers. </p> <br>
                <p> We donate a large amount of our profits to charities that help the British Army, we have very strong views about helping soldiers,
                    especially the injured who have been left to fend for themselves after war. </p>

                <h2> Our Ethics </h2> <br>
                <p> We believe people should be paid well when they work hard, that is why we make sure that all the coffee bean farmers that we purchase
                    from get paid fairly. The majority of companies only think about the product they have but now how their product was made, however we take into 
                    consideration the hard work that goes into our coffees. Not only our staff but the ingredients used like coffee beans. </p> <br>
                <p> Coffee bean farmers on average get paid £1.80 per kilo of coffee beans they produce, in our eyes this is simply not enough. We believe it is not fair that
                    companies can make large amounts of money whilst the people who work day and night for them get next to nothing. </p> <br>
                <p> We have considered everything and have decided to pay our coffee bean farms £4 per kilo they produce.</p>

                <h2> We want to help </h2> <br>
                <p> We are dedicated to helping the soldiers of the British Army, serving or ex-military. </p> <br>
                <p> We believe putting your life on the line to defend your country is an ultimate sacrifice and we want to make it easier for soldiers in need. </p> <br> 
                <p> When anyone spends money in our stores, 15% of the profits go to charities that help soldiers, these soldiers are anything from currently 
                    servering to having war injuries that have effected their life dramatically.</p>
                <p> We offer a high military discount, 30% to be exact on any order. </p> <br>

                <h2> We Focus On Waste </h2> <br>
                <p> Currently in the UK, many coffee shops will chuck out coffee beans that have gone to waste. This is mainly due to them not being used.
                    We want to be able to make them not go to waste and that is why we have started to use them for processing into fuels which powers biomass boilers. </p>
